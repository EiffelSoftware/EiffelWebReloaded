This project is to provide an easy way to build web application with Eiffel

= First step =
* provide a FastCGI implementation, to make it easy to deploy Eiffel web application on any popular httpd server  (Apache, IIS, lightTPD, nginx)
* build a web server framework:
  -give access to the server's data via the environment variables (query, ip, platform, ..)
  - but also to the request itself: cookies , get,post,delete,put type, and the related data
  - The FCGI would be just an implementation. We can imagine later to have SCGI, or even a pure Eiffel httpd server, and why not a specific protocol between httpd server and Eiffel web application (similar to FCGI).
  - This should also enable the developer to test the web application without requiring a real httpd server.

= Second step =
* build a web application framework, with more "application" logic behind
* provide a very easy way to publish API over REST server.
* this could lead to a first CMS (framework) written in Eiffel to make it very easy to build web application with Eiffel
* ask a few users from the community for feedback, and eventually specific contribution on existing code.

= Third step =
* provide more communication functionalities, in order to integrate other services (twitter, xmpp, ... and any services we can think of). This could lead to nice mashup.
* provide more components for authentication (openid, google connect, facebook connect, Oauth, ...), and any lib that could be useful (template engine, Wiki parser, diagram builder, and so on ...)
* call for contribution from the community
